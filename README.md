This project is a basic NodeJS web framework, similar to ExpressJS.

Currently the framework has very basic functionalities:

It creates the webserver.
Router with routes for the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE implemented.
Can process and parse the incoming message to extract querys and body data from the request.

There is a test API created using this framework for testing purposes.

I will continue to add features and improve the framework.
